# Copy an instance

Copying an instance allows you to create a copy of an existing instance. This is particularly good for scaling environments, replicating same instance state, creating backups before risky operations, or debugging instances that have encountered errors without affecting the original.

Important considerations before copying instances:

- Resource availability: Ensure the cluster has enough capacity (CPU, GPU, RAM) to host the new copy.
- State awareness: Understand that a copied instance will inherit the file system state of the source.
- Log isolation: When copying an instance in an error state, the new instance is a fresh clone and will not include logs from the source instance.

## Copy an instance

To copy an instance, follow these steps:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} CLI
:sync: cli

### Check the source instance status

Before initializing a copy, verify the status of the source instance. A copy operation is permitted only if the instance is in one of the following states:

- `Stopped`
- `Running` (requires --force or interactive confirmation to stop the instance)
- `Error` (requires --force or interactive confirmation to acknowledge logs will not be copied)

Check the instance status with:

    amc show <instance_id_or_name>

### Copy the instance

Use the `amc copy` command to create a new instance based on the source:

    amc copy <instance_id_or_name>

AMS will generate and return a unique ID for the new instance. By default, the copied instance remains in the `stopped` status once the operation succeeds. To start the instance afterward:

    amc start <new_instance_id>

Alternatively, use the `--launch` flag to start the instance immediately after the copy process completes:

    amc copy <instance_id_or_name> --launch

#### Specify a name

If you want to assign a specific name to the new instance, use the `--name` flag:

    amc copy <instance_id_or_name> --name instance-copy

#### Manual node selection

By default, AMS scheduler automatically selects the most suitable node for the new instance. You can manually target a specific node using the `--node` flag:

    amc copy <instance_id_or_name> --name instance-copy --node node1

This is especially useful for ensuring high availability by manually distributing instance copies across the cluster.
