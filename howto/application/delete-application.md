# Delete an application

When an application is no longer needed, it can be fully removed from Anbox Cloud. However, be mindful of the consequences that come with removing an application such as:

- Removal of associated base instances. Note that the base instance could first enter an error state before being cleaned up.
- Removal of all the versions of the deleted application.

Once you're sure you want to remove the application, you can delete it via the dashboard or the CLI.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} CLI
:sync: cli

Run:

    amc application delete bcmap7u5nof07arqa2ag

The command will ask for your approval before the application is removed. If you want to bypass the check, you can add the `--yes` flag to the command.
:::

:::{tab-item} Dashboard
:sync: dashboard

On the *Applications* page, click *Delete* ( ![delete application icon](/images/icons/delete-icon.png) ) and confirm the deletion.
