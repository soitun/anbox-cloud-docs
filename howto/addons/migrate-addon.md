# Migrate from previous versions

Starting with Anbox Cloud 1.12, use the following new hooks instead of the deprecated ones:

* Use `pre-start` instead of `install`
* Use `pre-start` instead of `restore`
* Use `post-start` instead of `prepare`
* Use `post-stop` instead of `backup`

The new hooks run for **all** types of instances (containers and virtual machines). To execute a hook only for a regular or a base instance, use the `INSTANCE_TYPE` environment variable. This variable is set to either `base` or `regular`.

For example, if you want to execute a hook only when your application is bootstrapped, you can do the following:
```bash
if [ "$INSTANCE_TYPE" = "regular" ]; then
  exit 0
fi

# Rest of the code for your addon
```

```{caution}
Copying your existing addons without modifications might have unintended side effects, because your hooks will run for every instance.
```
