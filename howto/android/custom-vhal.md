# Replace Anbox VHAL

*since 1.22.0*

```{note}
Replacing the Anbox VHAL is only supported on {ref}`AAOS images <ref-provided-images>`.
The Anbox Cloud dashboard does not support custom VHAL implementations.
```

This document will guide through the process of replacing the Anbox Cloud VHAL
implementation with your own implementation placed in the
[ODM partition](https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/partitions/odm-partitions)
using {ref}`exp-addons`.

## Prerequisites

Your custom VHAL implementation must provide an
[HIDL VHAL interface](https://source.android.com/docs/automotive/vhal/hidl-vhal-interface)
and be built against VNDK 34.

If your VHAL implementation requires additional libraries, they must also be
bundled with the addon and copied in the ODM partition.

## Create the addon

This addon will be tasked with the following:

1. Copying the VHAL binary to `/odm/bin/hw`.
2. Copying an
   <!-- wokeignore:rule=master -->
   [init.rc file](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/init/README.md)
   for your VHAL service to `/odm/etc/init`.
3. Disabling the Anbox Cloud VHAL by setting the `ro.anbox.automotive.vhal`
property to `odm`. This will be done by writing that system property to the
`/odm/etc/build.prop` file.

In the following example, we will name our addon `custom-vhal`.
To override the VHAL implementation, we will use a
{ref}`pre-start hook <ref-hooks>` which is executed
before Android gets started.

The directory layout for the addon is strict and must be:

```
custom-vhal/
├── hooks
│   └── pre-start
├── manifest.yaml
├── vhal
└── vhal.rc
```

As mentioned in the prerequisites, any additional libraries must also be bundled with the addon.

`vhal` is your custom VHAL implementation.

`vhal.rc` is an [init.rc file](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/main/init/README.md) for your VHAL service, such as:

```
service custom-vhal /odm/bin/hw/vhal
    class hal
    user vehicle_network
    group system inet
    disabled

on property:ro.anbox.automotive.vhal=odm
    start custom-vhal
```

`hooks/pre-start` must be an executable file which will handle the tasks
outlined at the beginning of this section, such as the following bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -x
#
# Copyright 2024 Canonical Ltd.  All rights reserved.
#

ANDROID_ODM_DIR="${ANBOX_DIR}/android-odm"

if [ "${INSTANCE_TYPE}" != base ]; then
    exit 0
fi

# Ensure all needed directories are created
mkdir -p "${ANDROID_ODM_DIR}/etc/init"
mkdir -p "${ANDROID_ODM_DIR}/bin/hw"

# Copy the custom VHAL and the associated init file in /odm
cp "${ADDON_DIR}/vhal" "${ANDROID_ODM_DIR}/bin/hw/"
cp "${ADDON_DIR}/vhal.rc" "${ANDROID_ODM_DIR}/etc/init/"

# Set the ro.anbox.anbox.vhal system property to 'odm'
echo "ro.anbox.automotive.vhal=odm" >> "${ANDROID_ODM_DIR}/etc/build.prop"
```

The {ref}`ref-addon-manifest` file
contains metadata:

```yaml
name: custom-vhal
description: |
  Addon replacing the Anbox Cloud VHAL with a custom implementation.
```

Once everything is in place, you can add the addon to your Anbox Cloud instance,
with:

```bash
amc addon add custom-vhal ./custom-vhal
```

Please note that due to Snap strict confinement, the addon directory
(`custom-vhal` here) must be located in the home directory of the user executing
the `amc` command.

## Use the addon

The newly added `custom-vhal` addon must now be enabled to be used with
Anbox Cloud applications.

If you plan to always override the Anbox Cloud VHAL implementation in all
applications, you can
enable the addon globally (see {ref}`howto-enable-addons-globally`):

```bash
amc config set application.addons custom-vhal
```

Otherwise, add it to your {ref}`ref-application-manifest`:

```yaml
name: my-app
addons:
  - custom-vhal
```

If you would like to further your custom implementation and integrate the Anbox HIDL interface with your custom VHAL implementation, follow the instructions in {ref}`howto-integrate-hidl`.
