# Stream page actions

When you are streaming an application or a device, a sidebar on the right side of the stream page provides access to several controls and information panels.

![Stream Page Actions Sidebar](/images/stream-sidebar/streaming-actions-sidebar-page.png)

This sidebar contains the following actions:

## Open developer tools

![Developer Tools Toggle](/images/stream-sidebar/developer-tools-toggle-icon.png)

*Shortcut: `Ctrl + Shift + D`*

The **Open developer tools** action opens a panel with various tools for developers to interact with the streaming session, including a terminal and logs for the running instance.

## Set up sharing

![Share Stream](/images/stream-sidebar/share-icon.png)

*Shortcut: `Ctrl + Shift + S`*

The **Set up sharing** action creates a temporary link to share your stream with another person, allowing them to take over the session from you. Note that simultaneous access is not allowed: when someone joins the stream, the currently connected user is disconnected.


## Connect ADB

![Connect ADB](/images/stream-sidebar/connect-adb-icon.png)

*Shortcut: `Ctrl + Shift + C`*

The **Connect ADB** action generates a pre-signed URL that can be used to connect to the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) for the running instance. It also provides [instructions](/howto/android/access-android-instance.md) on how to use the URL. This allows developers to interact with the Android instance using ADB commands, which is useful for debugging and testing applications.

## Show statistics

![Statistics Toggle](/images/stream-sidebar/statistics-toggle-icon.png)

*Shortcut: `Ctrl + Shift + M`*

The **Show statistics** action opens a panel that displays real-time streaming statistics. This information is useful for monitoring the performance and quality of the stream and can help diagnose streaming issues.

## Set location

*Shortcut: `Ctrl + Shift + G`*

![Location Toggle](/images/stream-sidebar/location-toggle-icon.png)

The **Set location** action opens a panel where you can set the geographic location (GPS coordinates) for the virtual device. This is useful for testing applications that rely on location services.

When you set a location, the virtual device behaves as if it is physically present at those coordinates.

This action might be missing from the sidebar for AAOS applications. In this case, the location section can be opened from the "Controls" panel.

## Full screen

![Full Screen Toggle](/images/stream-sidebar/full-screen-toggle-icon.png)

*Shortcut: `Ctrl + Shift + F`*

The **Full screen** action toggles the streaming session between full-screen and windowed mode.

## Enable / Disable stream resize

![Stream Resize Toggle](/images/stream-sidebar/stream-resize-toggle-icon.png)

*Shortcut: `Ctrl + Shift + R`*

The **Enable / Disable stream resize** action allows you to toggle resize mode, which allows to resize the stream, or reset its size to fit the whole available space.

When you initiate a bug report, the system collects relevant logs and session data that you can then send to developers to help them diagnose the issue.
