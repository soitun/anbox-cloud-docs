# ams.amc wait

Wait for an instance to reach a specific condition

## Synopsis

Wait for an instance to reach a specific condition.

You must specify one or multiple conditions with the '--condition'|'-c' flag.

A condition is of the form 'key=value', where 'key' is a supported attribute
and 'value' defines what to wait on.

Valid attributes:
 - For applications: published, status
 - For application versions: published, status
 - For instances: status

Use '--selector version=<version number>' to wait on an application version.
