# ams.amc node remove

Remove a node

## Synopsis

Remove a node.

Removing a node excludes it from the Anbox Cloud cluster and makes it unable to host containers.

You cannot delete a node with running containers unless you specify the '--force'|'-f' flag.


```
ams.amc node remove <name> [flags]
```

$ amc node remove lxd2

  -h, --help              help for remove
      --keep-in-cluster   Keep the LXD node as part of the cluster and just remove it from the AMS database
  -t, --timeout string    DEPRECATED: Maximum time to wait for the operation to complete (default "5m")
  -y, --yes               Assume 'yes' as answer to all prompts and run non-interactively
