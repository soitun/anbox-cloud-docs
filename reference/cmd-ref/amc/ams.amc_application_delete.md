# ams.amc application delete

Delete an application

Delete an application.

Deleting an application removes all of its versions. If you want to remove
only a specific version, you can use the '--version' flag.

Applications downloaded from the registry cannot be deleted unless
you specify the '--force'|'-f' flag.
